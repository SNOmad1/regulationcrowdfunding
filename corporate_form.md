# Corporate Governance for Primal ETH, Inc.

This document proposes a corporate governance structure for Primal ETH, a Delaware company.  As Primal ETH seeks to brand itself as an Ethereum-specific fundraising portal, an overall goal for this corporate structure is to use Ethereum-based applications wherever practicable.  This document is split up into the following three sections: (1) Stock; (2) Board of Directors; and (3) Shareholders Voting.  Each of these sections will give a brief overview of a proposal, followed by the relevant law governing each proposal, then followed by a more detailed explaination of the proposal.

## Stock

### Overview

### Relevant Law

### Purchase

In order for someone to purchase Primal ETH stock, they must have an Ethereum account with one of our Validation Tokens.

#### Validation Token

In order to accept an incoming transfer of Primal Token, an Ethereum address must have a Validation Token.  The Validation Token must verify that the owner of the Ethereum address has submitted his/her name and physical address so that it can be recorded onto Primal ETH's corporate ledger.  The Token must also be non-transferable so that another unregistered address cannot use it to purchase our stock.

Ideally, the corporate ledger would be updated automatically.  Here is an example of what our ledger should reflect:

Eth Address | Name | Address | Shares
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
0x9d6d492bD500DA5B33cf95A5d610a73360FcaAa0 | John Smith | 555 Aether Drive, New York, NY | 100
0x9d6d492bD500DA5B33cf95A5d610a73360FcaAa0 | Jane Roe | 444 Satoshi Wei, Denver, CO | 250

Information regarding the stockholder's name and address should not be made public, or stored on the blockchain.

There is the question of what happens if someone gives our ledger a fake name and address.  Purchasers should be warned beforehand, and even perhaps be forced to agree to a click-wrapped agreement, that if they give false information, their stock could be dissolved.  If we suspect fraud, we could verify the account by sending a letter to the address provided.  If we receive a return-to-sender, we could freeze the account until or unless the person listed in the ledger can verify his/her information.
