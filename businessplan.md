#BUSINESS PLAN FOR PRIMAL ETH, INCORPORATED

##Market

Primal ETH streamlines fundingraising for companies using the Ethereum network in compliance with the SEC.  The company will work with Ethereum developers to build fundraising mechanisms that are exempt from registration requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act.  One such mechanism is the Reg. CF exemption, which requires an intermediary to act as a middleman between issuers and purchasers of securities.  These intermediaries are called "Funding Portals."

Funding Portals must register with the SEC and become a member of FINRA.  FINRA currently lists 47 registered Reg CF Funding Portals on its [website](https://www.finra.org/about/funding-portals-we-regulate).  These portals generally fill niches, including only funding specific industries, servicing specific issuers, etc.  In the first three years of business, Primal ETH will fill a specific niche, that is to become an Ethereum-exclusive fundraising portal.

On June 18, 2019, the SEC issued a [report](https://cdn.crowdfundinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SEC-regulation-crowdfunding-2019_0.pdf) on Reg CF fundraising, finding the following:

>Between May 16, 2016 and December 31, 2018, we estimate that there were 1,351 offerings, excluding withdrawn filings, seeking in the aggregate a target, or minimum, amount of $94.3 million and a maximum amount of $775.9 million.

Broadly speaking, this market--startup businesses wishing to issue using Reg CF--is the market Primal ETH is targeting in its first three years.  The SEC reported a market growth of 52.4% in Reg CF's first year, and 55.4% growth in its second year.  Currently, the SEC is accepting comments from the public on Reg CF.
