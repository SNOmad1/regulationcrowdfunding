#DECENTRALIZED REGULATION FUNDRAISING PORTAL DEMONSTRATION

## Plain English Overiew

We're building an SEC-compliant funding portal that need to verify that an individual actually exists, and that that invidual isn't spending more than $2,200 per year on this kind of fundraising (called "Regulation Fundraising).  The goal is to make this portal as a decentralized application ("DApp") using uPort, Chainlink, and OpenLaw.

## Legal Overview

The objective of this project is to present the Securities and Exchange Commission with a working model for a decentralized fundraising portal that's compliant with [17 CFR §§ 200, 227, 232, 239, 240, 249, 269, & 274 (2016)](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2015/33-9974.pdf).  This working model is intended to streamline SEC compliant fundraising using the [OpenLaw](OpenLaw.io) platform and Ethereum token sales.

Issuers using Regulation Crowdfunding are can raise up to $1.07 million within a 12-month period from the general public, including non-accredited investors.  However, these individual investors are restricted by the amount they are allowed to invest.  The SEC provided a chart showing the different limits investors are able to make depending on their annual income or net worth.  In order to ensure investors aren't exeeding their limit, the SEC has put into place, what they call, "funding portals," private businesses acting as brokers or intermediaries for the issuers and investors.  Specifically, the SEC defines funding portals as

>any [broker] acting as an intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or sale of securities for the account of others, >solely pursuant to Securities Act Section 4(a)(6), that does not: (1) offer investment advice or recommendations; (2) solicit >purchases, sales or offers to buy the securities offered or displayed on its website or portal; (3) compensate employees, >agents or other persons for such solicitation or based on the sale of securities displayed or referenced on its website or >portal; (4) hold, manage, possess or otherwise handle investor funds or securities; or (5) engage in such other activities as >the Commission, by rule, determines appropriate. [Source:](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2015/33-9974.pdf). [Note that rule >300(c)(2) modified Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80) by changing "person" to "broker."]

In addition, these funding portals must register with the SEC as a broker under Exchange Act Section 15(b), or as a funding portal pursuant to Section 4A(a)(1) and proposed Rule 400 of Regulation Crowdfunding (See Rule 300(a)).  The funding portals also must register with any applicable self-regulatory organization, as defined in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(26).  Exchange Act Section 3(h)(1)(B) separately requires, as a condition of the exemption from broker registration, that a funding portal be a member of a national securities association that is registered with the Commission under Exchange Act Section 15A. Id.  In other words, the portal has to also register with FINRA.

The project is divided into the following three parts: (1) Issuer Streamlining; (2) Purchaser Portal; and (3) Identity Solutions.  Each of these parts are described below.

## Part 1: Issuer Streamlining
